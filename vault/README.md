# Vault

This directory contains archived configurations, reference materials, and historical files that are not part of the active configuration but are preserved for reference or inspiration.

## Contents

### zsh-templates/

Legacy zsh configuration from before migrating to oh-my-zsh. These templates represent the original custom setup and are kept as a reference for:

- Ideas for new aliases, functions, or configurations
- Comparison with current oh-my-zsh setup
- Historical reference of configuration evolution

These files are not used by the current setup but provide a source of inspiration for improvements and additions.

## Purpose

The vault serves as a repository for:

- Legacy configurations that may inform future changes
- Downloaded resources and documentation for reference
- Archived materials that don't belong in active configuration directories
- Historical snapshots of configuration approaches

Files in this directory should be:

- Not sourced or used by any active configuration
- Preserved for reference, inspiration, or historical interest
- Organized by topic or original purpose
