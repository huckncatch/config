# This file is intentionally minimal and serves as documentation.
#
# MACHINE-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION:
# This system uses XDG Base Directory compliant configuration.
# Machine-specific zsh profile settings are located at:
#
#   ~/.config/zsh/profile.local
#
# That file is sourced from ~/.zshrc and defines:
# - ZSH_THEME (the oh-my-zsh theme to use)
# - plugins (array of oh-my-zsh plugins to load)
#
# TO CUSTOMIZE:
# Edit ~/.config/zsh/profile.local (not this file)
#
# ARCHITECTURE:
# The loading order is:
#   ~/.zshrc
#   ├─ ~/.config/zsh/profile.local (theme + plugins)
#   └─ ~/config/zsh/zshrc.base (shared configuration)
#
# See ~/config/CLAUDE.md for complete documentation.
